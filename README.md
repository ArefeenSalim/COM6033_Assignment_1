# Reflection

## Design and implementation
### - A supervised regression approach was chosen because the task involves predicting a continuous numerical value, like the selling price of UK residential properties, using historical transaction data where the target value is known.
### - Linear regression was used as a baseline model to give an initial reference point for performance. It provides a simple to understand how different property features relate to house prices before applying more advanced regression techniques.
### - To improve model performance and address the limitations of the baseline linear regression model, Ridge regression and Lasso-style regularisation were introduced. These models help control overfitting and reduce issues caused by having many related input features, which were created when categorical variables such as property type, tenure, and county were converted into numerical form using one-hot encoding.
### - A ColumnTransformer was used to apply appropriate preprocessing steps to different feature types, including one-hot encoding for categorical variables and standardisation for numerical features such as year and month. This ensured that all input features were in a suitable format for model training.
### - Pipelines were used to combine preprocessing and model training into a single workflow. This approach reduced the risk of data leakage and ensured that the same preprocessing steps were applied consistently during training and when making predictions in the deployed application.
### - The final model was saved using joblib, as it provides a simple and reliable way to store and reload trained machine learning models in Python. The saved model was then integrated into a Flask web application, allowing users to enter property details and receive estimated UK property prices, showing how the trained model can be used in a real, interactive system.

## Challenges Encountered 
### - One of the main challenges encountered during this project was working with the size and structure of the UK Land Registry dataset. The data was provided across two CSV files and contained a very large number of records, which required careful handling to avoid performance and memory issues. Combining the files into a single dataset while maintaining data integrity was an important initial step before any further analysis could take place.
### - Another challenge involved cleaning and preparing the data for machine learning. The dataset contained a mixture of numerical, categorical, and administrative fields, many of which were not directly useful for predicting property prices. Identifying which features to retain and which to remove required careful inspection of the dataset and an understanding of the problem domain. In addition, several variables, including prices and dates, were initially stored as strings and needed to be converted into appropriate numerical formats before modelling could begin.
### - The property price data also caused challenges due to its highly uneven distribution. The extremely large price values made it difficult for regression models to perform effectively, which required the use of a logarithmic transformation to stabilise the data. In addition, deploying the trained model into a Flask web application introduced further challenges, particularly in ensuring that user inputs were correctly converted into the format expected by the model and that preprocessing steps were applied consistently during prediction.

## Model Evaluation
### - Model performance was evaluated using Variance (R^2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Each metric was chosen because it highlights a different aspect of how well the model performs. R^2 shows how much of the change in property prices can be explained by the input features, giving a clear sense of how useful the model is overall. MAE measures the average difference between the predicted prices and the actual prices, making it easy to understand how far predictions usually are from the true values. RMSE gives more weight to larger prediction errors, which helps reveal situations where the model struggles, particularly for very expensive or less common properties. Together, these metrics provide a balanced and reliable way to evaluate the accuracy and behaviour of the model.
### - The baseline linear regression model achieved reasonable performance, showing that there is a clear linear relationship between the selected features and property prices. This means that factors such as property type, tenure, location, and time of sale do have a measurable influence on price. Although the model was relatively simple, its results confirmed that the chosen features contained useful information and provided a solid starting point for more advanced models to improve upon.
### - Ridge regression consistently produced the strongest results across the evaluation metrics. The improvement in performance indicates that regularisation helped control the effect of the large number of features created through one-hot encoding of categorical variables such as property type, tenure, and county. By reducing the influence of less important or overlapping encoded features, the model became more stable and produced more reliable predictions on unseen data.
### - The Lasso-style model was useful for controlling model complexity, as it reduced the influence of less important features created through encoding. However, it did not outperform Ridge regression. This suggests that, for this dataset, reducing the strength of many features while keeping them in the model worked better than completely removing some features.
### - The evaluation results were reflected in the behaviour of the deployed Flask application, where the Ridge regression model consistently produced stable and realistic property price estimates across a range of user inputs. This reinforced confidence that the model was not only performing well during evaluation but also behaving reliably when used in a practical application.

## Future Improvements 
### - The Flask web application could be extended to support more detailed location inputs, such as town or district, rather than only county level information. These features were removed during model development due to their very high number of unique values, which significantly increased model dimensionality and complexity. In future work, encoding based on average regional prices could be applied to allow precise location input within the app without negatively impacting performance.
### - The current application accepts a limited set of user inputs in order to keep the interface simple and user-friendly. If additional property data were available, the app could be expanded to include property size, number of bedrooms, or radius, which would likely improve prediction accuracy.
### - From a usability perspective, the application could be enhanced by providing clearer input validation and guidance within the user interface, ensuring that user submissions are consistent and reducing the likelihood of invalid input values.
### - As a future improvement, the application could be moved to a cloud platform so it can be accessed online rather than only running locally. This would make the system more realistic and closer to how machine learning applications are usually shared and used outside of a development environment.
